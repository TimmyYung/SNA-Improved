        <p>

            With the arrival of November, Remembrance Day is at the forefront of attention. The latter part of the month sees the attention shift to another form of remembrance: the White Ribbon cause. The origins of the White Ribbon campaign lie in a bloodstained past.

            A tiny, dingy hole sits in the ground, filled with barely enough water to meet your needs for a single day. Leading from it, is a mile long line of people carrying canisters, and waiting for what seems like an eternity in the scorching heat.
